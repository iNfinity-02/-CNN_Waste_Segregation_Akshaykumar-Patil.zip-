# -CNN_Waste_Segregation_Akshaykumar-Patil.zip-
This project applies deep learning techniques to enhance recycling efficiency, reduce environmental pollution and promote sustainable waste management practices.
Task: Waste classification using CNNs.
Dataset: Images of seven waste categories: Food Waste, Metal, Paper, Plastic, Other, Cardboard, and Glass.
Data Structure: Seven folders, each containing images belonging to a specific waste category. No further sub-categorization within the folders. Approximately 7,000 images in total.
Problem: Improper waste disposal leading to environmental issues and inefficient recycling. Manual sorting is inefficient.
Business Objective: To develop an AI-powered waste classification system to automate waste segregation, reduce costs, and improve recycling rates.
Key Business Benefits:
Automated waste sorting (time and labor savings).
Increased recycling rates through accurate classification.
Use Cases:
Smart Recycling Bins.
Automated Waste Sorting Facilities.
Waste Monitoring and Reporting.
